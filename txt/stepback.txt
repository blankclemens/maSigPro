Fitting a linear model by backward-stepwise regression.

Description:

     'stepback' fits a linear regression model applying backward-stepwise strategy.

Usage:

      stepback(y,d,alfa = 0.05) 

Arguments:

     y: dependent variable 

     d: data frame containing by columns the set of variables that could be in the 	selected model.
  
     alfa: significance level to decide if a variable is or is not in the model.
    
Details:

     The strategy begins analysing a model with all the variables included in d. If 	     all the variables are statistically significant (all the variables have a 	            p-value less than alfa)  this model will be the result, either, the least  	     statistically significant variable will be removed and the model is 	            re-calculated and the argument is repeated up to find a model with all the 	     variables statistically significant.
     Each time that a variable is removed from matrix d, it is considered the      possibility of one or more removed variables can come in again. 
       
     
Value:
	
     'stepback' returns an object of 'class' "lm", where the model uses "y" as       dependent variable and all the selected variables from "d" as independent       variables. 
             
     The function 'summary' are used to obtain and print a
     summary and analysis of variance table of the results.  The
     generic accessor functions 'coefficients', 'effects',
     'fitted.values' and 'residuals' extract various useful features of
     the value returned by 'lm'.
