plot.groups                   package:maSigPro                   Documentation

Function for plotting gene expression profile at different experimental groups

Description:

     This function displays the gene expression profile for each experimental group in a time series
     gene expression experiment             

Usage:

      plot.groups (data, time, groups, repvect, show.fit = FALSE, betas = NULL,  groups.vector = NULL, 
      show.lines = TRUE, xlab ="time", cex.xaxis = 1, ylim = NULL, cexlab = 1, main = NULL, sub = NULL)

Arguments:

     data: vector or matrix containing the gene expression data
    
     time: vector indicating time assigment for each array

     repvect: index vector indicating experimental replicates

     groups: matrix indicating experimental group to which each array is assigned

     show.fit: Logical indicating whether regression fit curves must be plotted

     betas: Required when show.fit = TRUE. Matrix of regression coefficients

     groups.vector: Required when show.fit = TRUE. Vector indicating experimental group of each variable

     show.lines: Logical indicating whether a line must be drawn joining plotted data points for reach group '

     xlab, cex.axis, ylim, cexlab, main, sub: general arguments for plotting
 
Details:

     When data is a matrix, the average expression value is displayed
  
     When there are array replicates in the data (as indicated by repvect), values are averaged by repvect

     When a regression fit has been computed, the regression curves can be plotted aswell by setting 'show.fit' = TRUE
     and providing regression coefficients in 'betas'. When regression coefficients have been calculated by maSigPro
     functions, the 'groups.vector' object must be also provided.

Value:

    plot of groups profiles
