Average rows by match & index

Description:

     'average.rows' matches rownames of a matrix to a 'match' vector and performs averaging of the rows
      by the index provided by an 'index' vector               

Usage:

      average.rows (x, index, match, r = 0.7)  

Arguments:

     x: a matrix

     match: match vector for indexing rows

     index: index vector indicating how rows must be averaged

     r: minimal correlation value between rows to compute average
    
Details:

    rows will be averaged only if the pearson correlation coefficient between all rows of each given
    index is greater than r. If not, that group of rows is discarded in the result matrix.    
     
Value:

    a matrix where 'nrows' equals 'length(unique(index))'
