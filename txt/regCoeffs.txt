reg.coeffs                   package:maSigPro                   Documentation

Calculate true regression coefficients 

Description:

     'reg.coeffs' re-calculates groups regression coefficients from dummy variables regression coefficients 

Usage:

      reg.coeffs (coefficients, abcissa = "Time", groups.vector, group)  

Arguments:

     coefficients: vector of regression coefficients obtained from a regression model with dummy variables

     abcissa: variable x of the regression formula

     group: group for which regression coefficients are to be computed 
  
     groups.vector: vector with the group value of each variable in 'coefficients' 
       
Details:

     regression coefficients in coefficients vector should be ordered by natural position in a regression formula,
     ie: intercept, x term, x^2 term, X^3 term, and so on... 

Value:
   
    reg.coeff: vector of calculated regression coefficients
